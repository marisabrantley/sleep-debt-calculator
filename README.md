# Sleep Debt Calculator Project

Do you get enough sleep? In this Codecademy JavaScript functions project, we created a program to determine:

1. Whether youâ€™re getting enough sleep each week;

1. The actual and ideal hours of sleep for each night of the last week; and

1. How far - in hours - you are from your weekly sleep goal.
